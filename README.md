# Music-signout

# This is a project designed to solve the confusing music signout problem at Aurora High School
# The default username and password for teacher is user: teacher pass: teacher123
# In order to use the program you first need to add the proper students and instruments using the teacher login
# Make sure to select not in use when adding instruments 
# Logout 
# Students then should be able to type in their student number and scan in the barcode number to sign out an instrument
# They cannot sign out instruments that are already borrowed
