Tested all tables add, edit and delete
Tested teacher login
Found bugs in how to edit and delete student 
Found bugs in after adding something to the database the drop down would reload the page
Found bugs in after logging out and going back still being able to see the tables


--Conclusion--
During testing, all database tables were successfully verified for add, edit, and delete operations. The teacher login functionality was tested and confirmed to be working correctly. 

However, several bugs were identified: 
- Editing and deleting student records showed issues.
- Dropdown menus caused the page to reload after adding new entries to the database.
- There were problems with session handling where logging out did not immediately restrict access, allowing visibility of tables even after logging out. 

These issues require further debugging and resolution.
